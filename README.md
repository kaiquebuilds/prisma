Prisma is a modern personal finance application built to help Brazilians manage their money effectively. It addresses the core problem of financial anxiety and lack of clarity by providing a consolidated, intuitive view of personal finances.

It's built for:

- Alex, The Planner: Who seeks optimization and a clear understanding of where their money goes.
- Juliana, The Overwhelmed: Who desires to reduce financial stress and gain control over their spending and upcoming obligations.

These were identified as key personas through interviews with potential users and out of my own frustration, focusing on the unique challenges and needs in managing personal finances in Brazil. For more details, check out the [Personas document](./docs/product/personas.md).

## ✨ Why I'm Building This

I'm building Prisma to:

1. Solve mine and my family's financial management challenges by creating a tailored solution that fits our specific needs.
2. Build a comprehensive portfolio project to showcase my full-stack engineering skills. It demonstrates my ability to design and implement a production-ready application, applying advanced architectural patterns and best practices.
