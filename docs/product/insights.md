Prisma was born out of my frustration with my current spreadsheet setup. After a few years I came up with something I find useful, but I took notes on what could be improved:

- The position of the cells influence computations, which restricts layout and styling possibilities for better visual organization of hierarchy.
- Adding a new entry generally means having to move a lot of stuff around — while being careful to not mess with the logic —, adding new categories is even harder.
- I like to simulate new purchases, income, savings, etc., but I have to be careful to not mess with my current set-up. (Create copies and stuff).
- I have to manually update recurring entries
- Hard to input and modify data using my phone.
- I don’t know and don’t wanna study how to categorize, filter or group things, to have a clear view of where my money is going.
- Labeling each expense drains my energy, as with time I generally just group expenses through credit cards to simplify stuff — which make me lose context.
- I want to be more informed on what’s going on through time, like which costs could be cut. I want to easily make use of my past data instead of just archiving it.
- I would like to have important dates mapped out, like the due date of my credit cards, the day I’ll receive money, etc. → Seeing how much money I’ll have at a specific day/week/period, instead of just monthly.
- I want to know how much money I have I have/project to have at any given date so I can make informed decisions when using my money.
- I want to see graphical visualizations of my financial life through time in order to inform me in a quick and easy to grasp manner.
- Making poor financial decisions when needed in day-to-day life because I do my financial analysis monthly (when I do).
- Using spreadsheets is cumbersome, structure and functionality are tied together and it takes too many steps to do something simple, like project expenses (something that shouldn't even manual). The way I want to forecast would require me to learn advanced Excel, which may be a good thing in the future.
- I want to manage my financial goals and applications, see how they're performing, but mainly simulating things to achieve the best outcomes.
- The idea is for it to be an infinite calendar, projecting based on the recurrence of expenses and incomes.
- I'd like to know how much money I have and will have in each day, know bills I've paid and which I didn't, who owes me money and when should I receive it.
- I want to change the time span and be able to see a forecast for years, months, weeks and days.
- There could be an easier way to input information, like parsing a pdf file for the credit card bill or taking a photo of a receipt.
