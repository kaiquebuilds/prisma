# What is Prisma

## Introduction: The Idea

The core idea behind Prisma is to move beyond passive expense tracking and offer proactive, real-time guidance. It is built on the belief that financial wellness is achieved not by simply showing users where their money went, but by giving them clear, simple guardrails to help them decide where it should go next.

The problem we solve is twofold: the **lack of clarity** for those who have a stable income but don't know where their money is going, and the **overwhelming anxiety** for those who are trapped in a cycle of debt and feel that no amount of effort will change their situation.

## Strategy

Our overarching strategy is to capture and retain a segment of the market that has been abandoned by overly complex financial tools. We will achieve this by focusing on a user experience that is built on empathy, simplicity, and tangible results.

**Product Objectives:**

1. **Reduce User Anxiety:** Our primary measure of success is a reduction in our users' financial stress. We will achieve this through features that offload their mental burden, such as the "Upcoming Bills" and "Safe to Spend Today" components.
2. **Drive Behavioral Change:** The product is designed to gently guide users toward better financial habits. By treating savings as "transfers" and framing budgeting as "planning," we empower users to see their finances in a more positive and proactive light.
3. **Achieve High User Retention:** Unlike apps that are used for a month and abandoned, Prisma is designed to become an indispensable daily tool. Retention will be driven by the user seeing real-world results: reduced debt, achieved savings goals, and a newfound sense of control.
4. **Establish a Foundation for Future Growth:** The MVP is focused and lean, but the architecture is designed to scale.
